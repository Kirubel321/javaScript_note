#javascript

1. **Conditional statement**

* JavaScript has a similar set of control structures to other languages in the C family. Conditional statements are supported by if and else
```
Example:
let name = "kittens";
if (name === "puppies") {
  name += " woof";
} else if (name === "kittens") {
  name += " meow";
} else {
  name += "!";
}
name === "kittens meow";
```
* Conditional (ternary) operator
